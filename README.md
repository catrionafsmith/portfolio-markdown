### LearnCodeEmpower
I created a chatbot using the OpenAI API and deployed it using Netlify and Netlify serverless functions. This chatbot was for a CodeFirstGirls WebDev group challenge where I was part of a group that created a website to find free tech courses and tech volunteering opportunities for women. 

Try out the finished website here! https://learncodeempower.netlify.app/

The tech used within this project was: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery terminal and the OpenAI API. It was deployed using Netlify serverless functions on Netlify.

A demonstration of the AI chatbot created for this project is below.
